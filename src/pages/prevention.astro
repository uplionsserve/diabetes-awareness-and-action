						The numbers are staggering—an estimated 1 out of 3
						adults live with prediabetes.
					</li>
					<li>
						Type 2 diabetes affects about 95% of the people living
						with diabetes and has a lifestyle link.
					</li>
					<li>
						Type 1 diabetes is NOT linked to lifestyle and cannot be
						prevented; people with type 1 diabetes have to use
						insulin every day to live.

						One of the most problematic facts about prediabetes is
						that most people don't even know they have it.
					</li>
					<li>Prediabetes can be a silent disease.</li>
					<li>
						Prediabetes has one or more of the following risk
						factors:
					</li>
					<ul class="secondaryList">
						<li>Overweight</li>
						<li>45 years of age or older</li>
						<li>A parent, brother, or sister with diabetes</li>
						<li>Physically active less than three times a week</li>
						<li>
							If a woman, a history of gestational diabetes or
							polycystic ovary disease
						</li>
						<li>High blood pressure</li>
						<li>
							Black, Hispanic, Indigenous, and Asian ethnic/race

					<li>
						Group based diabetes prevention programs are available
						in-person and online.
					</li>
					<li>
						The CDC has been facilitating the implementation of
						group-based Diabetes Prevention Programs (DPP), using
						leaders who have been through DPP life coach training.
					</li>
					<li>
						Designed for people at high risk of developing diabetes
						like those with prediabetes or women who have a past
						history of gestational diabetes, the DPP meets
						approximately 16 times over the first 6 months and then
						once a month for the next 6 months.
					</li>
					<li>
						Online programs like Zoom are available and convenient
						options for people who find it difficult to attend in
						person programs or do not have access to diabetes
						prevention programs in their regions.
					</li>
					<li>
						The program is also offered in several areas across the
						U.P. Dial 2-1-1 or log onto www.diabetesinmichigan.org
						to find where diabetes prevention programs are offered
						in the Upper Peninsula.

					<li>Coping with triggers:</li>
					<li>
						External Triggers: For many people, seeing food,
						smelling it or remembering that a particular food is in
						the house can trigger them to eat. A little or a lot of
						extra food here and there can lead to weight gain – 100
						extra calories a day may yield 10 pounds of weight gain
						in a year.
					</li>
					<li>
						Fun Time Triggers: Being out with other people –eating
						out, socializing or at a party is usually associated
						with taking in more calories. People will often eat more
						and/or drink more when they are with other people.
					</li>
					<li>
						Emotional Triggers: Some of us deal with negative
						emotions through eating, especially while alone. Finding
						other ways to more effectively prevent or address
						negative emotions, like going for a walk or phoning a
						friend is important.
					</li>
					<li>
						Despite these triggers, sometimes you really are hungry
						and just need to eat!

					<li>Managing stress:</li>
					<li>
						Feelings of stress release the hormone cortisol which
						helps raise the blood sugar and facilitates other
						changes in the body to prepare you for ‘fight or
						flight.’
					</li>
					<li>
						If you constantly feel under stress, cortisol can work
						to push you toward developing type 2 diabetes.
					</li>
					<li>
						The other way that stress impacts type 2 diabetes
						development is through the unhealthy behaviors that
						often occur when a person feels ‘stressed out’.
					</li>
					<li>
						Some of the ways to reduce or manage stress that are
						addressed in the DPP include:
					</li>
					<ul class="secondaryList">
						<li>Asking for help from others</li>
						<li>Learning to say no</li>
						<li>Getting enough sleep</li>
						<li>
							Knowing yourself – what are the things that cause
							you stress?
						</li>
						<li>Making time for fun</li>
						<li>Having a to-do list</li>
						<li>Setting small, doable goals</li>
						<li>Getting active</li>
						<li>
